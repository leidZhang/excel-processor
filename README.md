# excel-processor
## Introduction
This is a simple excel file process program that I created with Python. 

## How to Use
To start the program, double click main.py, then click "Open Excel File" button and select a valid excel file, then the table will be showed above. Users can select one of the row and update or delete it. The home menu also have fuzzy search function, an advanced search function is also provided. 

### Note: Currently this program can only process the first table of the file and any manipulation of the data will be automatically saved to the excel file.
